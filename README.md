TODO: This needs to be GREATLY expanded.

Current status - well, it at least compiles. There's a lot of work to do to get this
running again. Probably need to completely overhaul the actual 
classifier. Might need to swap out the feature extractor and DSP.
Want to consider whether this can be done in HTML5 / JS so it is more
portable.
